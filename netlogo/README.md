## This folder contains Netlogo files from work done at the Santa Fe Institute

This is a collection of my early attempts at ABM programming in the Netlogo environment. It is also a very poor example of my earlier attempts at version control. The one that may be most helpful to anyone trying to figure out (a) what this was for, or (b) some Netlogo programming, would probably be "PreyAdultJuvFishermanModel_v_18_ProduceTimeSeries". Enjoy!

SFI-COA-Senior-Project
======================

This will be the final resting place for the code pertaining to my senior thesis, "Evaluating Methods for Detecting Critical Transitions in Agent-based Models".

Mostly, it will consist of the Python files which "did the work" and the LaTeX write-up which followed. I'll probably not tweak any of this stuff anymore, since the project is (for intents and purposes) complete. But if anyone browses this and sees something fun/off/weird/cool, let me know!

-k.

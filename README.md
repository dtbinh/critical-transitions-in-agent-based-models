SFI-COA-Senior-Project
======================

This will be the final resting place for the code pertaining to my senior thesis, "Evaluating Methods for Detecting Critical Transitions in Agent-based Models". Work here began (in a drastically different form) at the Santa Fe Institute's REU Program during the summer of 2013. Loads of appreciation go to all of my student colleagues there (esp. Robert Hawkins; for general knowledge, great music taste, and good company) and mentors, Dr. Marcus Hamilton and Dr. Matthew Koehler.

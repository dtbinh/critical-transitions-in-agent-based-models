Santa Fe Institute / College of the Atlantic Senior Project
======================

This repo is the final resting place for the code pertaining to my senior thesis, "Evaluating Methods for Detecting Critical Transitions in Agent-based Models". Work here began (in a drastically different form) while I was a research assistant at the Santa Fe Institute during the summer of 2013 and was finished at College of the Atlantic in 2014. Much thanks to Dr. Dave Feldman, Dr. Matthew Koehler, Dr. Marcus Hamilton, Ashkaan Fahimipour, and everyone else at the Santa Fe Institute. 

This repo contains the following folders:

* Python
* graphics
* Netlogo
* writeup

Python contains most of the final versions of Python code related to this project--specifically the agent-based model utilized in the report. The graphics folder contains all of the various plots/media files utilized in the final write-up and is probably of little interest (unless you happen to be very curious about how bad my file naming conventions used to be.) Netlogo contains most of the NetLogo files from my time at the Santa Fe Institute and could be useful for those interested in doing primitive ecological modeling in NetLogo. writeup contains, obviously, the LaTeX write-up files, style sheet, and necessary library.bib stuff. I'd recommend just reading the final .pdf, if interested.  

Enjoy!

SFI-COA-Senior-Project
======================

This will be the final resting place for the code pertaining to my senior thesis, "Evaluating Methods for Detecting Critical Transitions in Agent-based Models". Work here began (in a drastically different form) at the Santa Fe Institute's REU Program during the summer of 2013 and was finished at College of the Atlantic in 2014. Much thanks to Dr. Dave Feldman, Dr. Matthew Koehler, Dr. Marcus Hamilton, and all the rest of the SFI REU Crew. 

This repo contains the following folders:

* Python
* graphics
* Netlogo
* writeup

The Python folder contains most of the final versions of Python work for this project (some earlier work was left un-pushed). The graphics folder contains all of the various plots/media files utilized in the final write-up. Netlogo contains most of the Netlogo files from my time at the Santa Fe Institute. writeup contains, obviously, the LaTeX write-up files, style sheet, and necessary library.bib stuff. The other files are the final products, should anyone want to read them. 

Thanks!

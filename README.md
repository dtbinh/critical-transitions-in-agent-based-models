SFI-COA-Senior-Project
======================

This will be the final resting place for the code pertaining to my senior thesis, "Evaluating Methods for Detecting Critical Transitions in Agent-based Models". Work here began (in a drastically different form) at the Santa Fe Institute's REU Program during the summer of 2013 and was finished at College of the Atlantic in 2014. Much thanks to Dr. Dave Feldman, Dr. Matthew Koehler, Dr. Marcus Hamilton, and all the rest of the SFI REU Crew.
